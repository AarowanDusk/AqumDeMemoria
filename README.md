## Replicated Parkour System with MotionWarping Integration

**This project implements a versatile parkour system designed to provide fluid and dynamic character movement across various surfaces in Unreal Engine 5.**

**Key Features:**

* **Custom Movement Component:** A custom movement component takes center stage, enabling precise character translation and rotation based on valid raycast results. This component empowers intricate calculations for realistic parkour maneuvers.
* **Surface Interaction:** The system excels at handling interactions with different surfaces, allowing the character to seamlessly traverse atop, below, or onto platforms, as dictated by successful raycast detections.
* **MotionWarping Integration:** Harnessing the power of Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5 MotionWarping plugin, this project enhances the parkour experience by ensuring smooth transitions between animations, further amplifying the responsiveness and fluidity of character movement.

**Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Character Control:** The custom movement component fosters precise character manipulation, granting developers greater control over parkour mechanics.
* **Realistic Movement:** The system facilitates realistic interactions with various surfaces, fostering a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience.
* **MotionWarping Smoothness:** The integration of MotionWarping leads to seamless transitions between animations, adding a layer of polish to the parkour system.

**Potential Applications:**

* **Action Games:** This system can be a valuable asset for action games where fluid character movement plays a crucial role.
* **Platformers:** Platformers can benefit from the precise surface interaction and character control offered by this parkour system.
* **First-Person Shooters:** In first-person shooters, parkour mechanics can introduce new tactical elements and movement possibilities.
